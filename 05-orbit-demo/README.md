/seedkit-slim

Project name: 06-silk-lab
Purpose: profile a few request paths with django-silk and run a simple background email task on the DB backend.

Settings layout: split.
Database: PostgreSQL.
Postgres location: on the host (use `createdb silk_db`).
Lint with Ruff: yes.
Test runner: pytest (required for django-test-migrations).
Type check (pyright + django-stubs): no.
Pre-commit hooks: no.
Internationalisation (i18n): no.
Custom user model: no.
Auth add-on: none.
Structured logging: no.
Task runner: none.
Add-ons:
  - debug: django-silk (profiling + `@silk_profile`)
  - tasks: Django Tasks with the Database backend (`django-tasks-db`). Also `uv run manage.py startapp jobs`, register `jobs` in `INSTALLED_APPS`, wire `jobs/apps.py` `ready()` to import `tasks`, and add a sample `@task` to `jobs/tasks.py`.
  - analytics: GoatCounter (self-hosted snippet, env-driven site code)
  - email: console backend in local (`EMAIL_URL=consolemail://`).
  - CORS: no.
  - REST API: none.
  - Frontend: none.
  - Devcontainer: no.
  - Health check endpoints: yes.
  - `robots.txt`: no.
  - `django-extensions`: yes.
  - Database safety tools: all three —
      - django-zeal: yes
      - django-migration-linter: yes
      - django-test-migrations: yes

Production setup: skip.

Run the foundation, the boot check, start `manage.py db_worker` in a second terminal, enqueue one example task and confirm it runs. Hit a profiled view and confirm the request appears under `/silk/`. Run `uv run manage.py lintmigrations`. Run `uv run pytest` to confirm the test runner is wired (no project-specific tests required — `django-test-migrations` is installed for the user to write migration tests later).

/seedkit-slim

Project name: 05-orbit-demo
Purpose: scratch project to exercise django-orbit and verify outbound mail flows are captured.

Settings layout: single file.
Database: SQLite.
Lint with Ruff: yes.
Test runner: manage.py test (stock Django).
Type check (pyright + django-stubs): no.
Pre-commit hooks: no.
Internationalisation (i18n): no.
Custom user model: no.
Auth add-on: none.
Structured logging: no.
Task runner: none.
Add-ons:
  - debug: django-orbit (observability dashboard + MCP)
  - email: console backend in local, plus Mailpit running in Docker for richer inspection
  - CORS: no.
  - REST API: none.
  - Frontend: none.
  - Auth hardening: N/A (auth = none).
  - Health check endpoints: yes.
  - robots.txt: no.
  - django-extensions: no.
  - Devcontainer: no.
Run the foundation + boot check. Spin up Mailpit via a one-service `docker-compose.yml`, point Django at SMTP `localhost:1025`, send a test mail, and confirm it appears in Mailpit's UI on `:8025`.

# 05-orbit-demo

Scratch project to exercise **django-orbit** (observability dashboard + MCP) and verify outbound mail flows are captured by **Mailpit**.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Django 5.2 |
| Database | SQLite |
| Observability | django-orbit @ `/orbit/` |
| Email (local) | SMTP → Mailpit on port 1025 |
| Mailpit UI | http://localhost:8025 |
| Health checks | `/healthz` → `ok`, `/readyz` → `ready` |
| Lint | Ruff |

## Quick start

```sh
# Start Mailpit
docker compose up -d --wait

# Install deps & migrate
uv sync
uv run manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (optional, needed for /admin/)
uv run manage.py createsuperuser

# Run dev server
uv run manage.py runserver
```

## Key URLs

- Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
- Orbit dashboard: http://localhost:8000/orbit/
- Mailpit UI: http://localhost:8025/
- Health: http://localhost:8000/healthz
- Ready: http://localhost:8000/readyz

## Send a test mail

```sh
uv run manage.py shell -c "
from django.core.mail import send_mail
send_mail('hello', 'body', 'from@example.com', ['to@example.com'])
"
```

Then open http://localhost:8025 to inspect it.
